# portfolio-chronicles

I want to create a personal portfolio website should be separated into the following components in chronological order:
Header: routers to the respective components below; it should be a single page application and when a user clicks on a link to one of the components below, it should scroll to the relevant section smoothly
Component 1: Name + brief introduction of myself
Component 2: Showcase the projects that i have that should be linked to the respective github repos; each project be placed in a 'card' with an image followed by a brief description of the project
Component 3: A timeline of my previous work experience that show be follow a waterfall-esque flow with the most recent at the bottom
Component 4: Connect with me section that links to my linkedin and github

The UI should be fairly simple yet sophisticated that is easy on the eyes for viewers yet aesthetically pleasing.
